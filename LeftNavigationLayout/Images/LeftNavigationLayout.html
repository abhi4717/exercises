						The Discovery Channel MUST broadcast to the world their commitment
 to save the planet and to do the following IMMEDIATELY:

1. The Discovery Channel and it's affiliate channels MUST have daily 
television programs at prime time slots based on Daniel Quinn's "My 
Ishmael" pages 207-212 where solutions to save the planet would be done 
in the same way as the Industrial Revolution was done, by people 
building on each other's inventive ideas. Focus must be given on how 
people can live WITHOUT giving birth to more filthy human children since
 those new additions continue pollution and are pollution. A game show 
format contest would be in order. Perhaps also forums of leading 
scientists who understand and agree with the Malthus-Darwin science and 
the problem of human overpopulation. Do both. Do all until something 
WORKS and the natural world starts improving and human civilization 
building STOPS and is reversed! MAKE IT INTERESTING SO PEOPLE WATCH AND 
APPLY SOLUTIONS!!!!

2. All programs on Discovery Health-TLC must stop encouraging the birth 
of any more parasitic human infants and the false heroics behind those 
actions. In those programs' places, programs encouraging human 
sterilization and infertility must be pushed. All former pro-birth 
programs must now push in the direction of stopping human birth, not 
encouraging it.
